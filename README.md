# hotel-db

This is the database/api of a 3 part project.  The project is a hotel with a customer website to book rooms, a company page to handle the 
physical hotel's needs, and an api/database as the backend.

The three parts are hosted on Github and Heroku. The links can be found here:

The database is a mySQL database that is converted into a ClearDB for Heroku.  The api is using Express js to connect with the 
database once the endpoints are called.
